"""
Mouse Movement Simulator for Work Hours

This script automatically moves the mouse cursor to random screen positions
during configured work hours to maintain an 'active' system status.
It checks the current time against defined work hours and lunch break,
moving the mouse only during valid work periods.

Configuration:
- Work hours: 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- Lunch break: 12:45 PM - 12:47 PM
- Movement interval: Every 550 seconds (approximately 9 minutes)
